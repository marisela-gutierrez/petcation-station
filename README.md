# Description 
The purpose of this application is to allow pet owners to easily and securely find local, trustworthy pet sitters for a variety of potential services involving pet sitting. There are a number of different reasons as to why individuals would want to use this website, depending on their specific prerequisites. These include but are not limited to, pet owners who are looking for sitters, wether they are traveling on vaction and need their 4 legged friend a guardian while they are away, or if they are just in need of help with getting their pets out on walks. This will save pet owners the hassle of having to book their pets with usually more expensive pet care options, as well as provide secure way to connect with local community members who would like to make an extra buck. On the other side of the spectrum, we have inividuals who are looking for pet related work in their community. Pet owners will be required to complete a bio of either their pet/pets they would like to be looked after, containing any relevant inofrmation about their pet including breed, age, behavior characteristics, contact info and any other relevant information they feel sitters should be informed. Pet sitters will also be required to submit thier own bio containing availability, any job preferences, as well as briefly describing oneself. All users, owners or sitters, will be able to set filters on what they are looking for/what they would and would not be willing to do, making it effortless and quick for everyone to find their needs.
